# Label Analysis
The Jupyter Notebook, [label-analysis.ipynb](./label-analysis.ipynb), is used to analyse the label CSV files generated 
by [clean_label_csv.py](../labelling/clean_label_csv.py). It will show you the numbers of labels and the amount of data
used per label in the CSV file you provide.
